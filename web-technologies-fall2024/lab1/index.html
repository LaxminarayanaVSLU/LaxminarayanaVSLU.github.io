        <h1>Soccer⚽️</h1>
        <p>More commonly known as football or soccer,[a] is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each,
            who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of
            the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a
            rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two
            45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over
            200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</p>
